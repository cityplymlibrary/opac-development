			<h2 class="-ccp-heading-u">Help! I've forgotten my College password! How can I get access to my College account again?</h2>
			<p>Before coming to see us, make sure you're using the correct username for the service you want to access. Systems such as <strong>Moodle, bksb and Shibboleth (inc the Catalogue site)</strong> will expect <em>only your student ID number</em> (e.g. 10712345). To access <strong>Google services</strong>, you will need to put <em>cityplym.ac.uk</em> after your student ID number (e.g. 10712345@cityplym.ac.uk).</p>
			<p>Provided you're confident you're using the correct username, or alltogether can't remember your password, you now have two options:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>If you are <strong>able to come on-site</strong>, the fastest method of getting a new password is by visiting the <em>main counter at the Digital Village</em>. Refer to FAQ #1 for instructions on how to find us. Please remember to bring photo ID - <strong>preferably an up-to-date student ID card</strong>, otherwise a passport or driver's licence so we can issue you with a College ID card (Â£1 charge for a replacement).</li>
				<li>If you are <strong>unable to come on-site</strong></li>
